# TwitterStockMonitor
This project originally started when I noticed that if Trump mentioned a company within his tweets, their shares would either go up in price if the tweet was positive or drop if the tweet was negative. I decided to make a script to follow Trump and monitor the companies that he mentioned over a week, to see how the tweet affected the price of the company's shares. I have updated this to make it usable for multiple Twitter accounts at the same time. 

## Requirements
For this you will need:
- 
- Pinance
- Tweepy
- NLTK

These can be installed via:
```
pip install pinance
pip install tweepy
pip install nltk
```

## Setup
- You must first set up a [Twitter APP](https://themepacific.com/how-to-generate-api-key-consumer-token-access-key-for-twitter-oauth/994/)

- You need to set up an email and make sure that your account allows [less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)
- Input this data into the config file with your keys and email info like so:
